our substring matching rules:
searching:
    title: %title% (if contains that anywhere in the string)
    director: %director% (if contains that anywhere in the string)
    year: exact match
    star: %star% (if contains that anywhere in the string)
    browsing:
    genre:exact match
    title-number:%title-number% (if contains that anywhere in the string)
    title-char: title-char% (if pattern matches start of the string)

!!important!! if you send a page size on the main page, the change will not reflect until you click search movie again!
